The purpose of this is to provide compile time type checking of physical units. This reduces runtime bugs by making sure the units of different calculations always match at compile time.

Enforcing this rule without a mutidimensional array of unit names is difficult because it boils down to basic rules but these rules must be known by the compiler. and well... im not the compiler.



Units:
- Length
- Time
- Mass

- Velocity
- Acceleration
- Jerk
- Snap

- Force
- Energy
- Power
- pressure

- Moment of Inertia
- Torque
- Angular Acceleration

- Area
