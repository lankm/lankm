# Landon Moon

**Hello everyone!!** Most of my repositories are group projects from my education at UTA. I also have a couple personal projects as well.

I love implementing and optimizing algorithms along with backend systems, but a good UI never hurt anyone.


I finally moved my sandbox code from uta-repository to lankm. If you want to see the smaller projects I mess with that don't warrent a repository by itself, it should be here (or in the commit history).
